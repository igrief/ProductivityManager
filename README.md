# ProductivityManager
C# Windows Forms application for productivity, tools include todo list, timed reminders, and calendar events

Created by Isaiah Grief

This program is a toolkit for productivity. 

Use:
Users can add items to the todolist and remove them by checking the box.
Users can add items to the habit list and signify that the habit was done today by checking the box. Habits can be removed using the dropdown menu.
Reminders can be set for a specific time. Any reminders set for the past will trigger immediately. Reminders take the place of balloon popups on the bottom right of the screen.
Events can be set to recur daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. Selecting a calendar day will display the upcoming events on the right.
Weekly recurring events happen on the same day of the week. Monthly recurring events occur on the same day of the month, unless the selected month has fewer days, in which case no event is displayed. Annually recurring events behave similarly.
The timer and stopwatch are not saved between sessions. 
A session is only saved when the user clicks the save button on the top left. 
Upon closing and relaunching the application, the last saved session will be loaded automatically.
